# Description

TLS has a fundamental design flaw when using CBC cipher suites. TLS authenticates encrypted data using an insecure mac-then-encrypt construction, as opposed to the secure encrypt-than-mac. Cryptography researchers have shown that using mac-then-encrypt exposes TLS implementations to padding oracle attacks. Several of these attacks have been discovered and fixed over the years in different TLS implementations. Lucky Thirteen is one of the more recent attacks, in which a padding oracle creates a timing side-channel that may allow attackers to decrypt TLS traffic.

# Generic How-to fix

If you are running an up-to-date version of your TLS stack (e.g., OpenSSL), your server should be safe against Lucky Thirteen. However, remember that the attack stems from a design flaw in the protocol and it is not possible to be 100% sure that, in the future, a new padding oracle attack is not discovered. We recommend, provided this does not break compatibility with legacy clients (e.g. Windows XP), that you support only TLS version 1.2 or greater, and disable all CBC cipher suites.
