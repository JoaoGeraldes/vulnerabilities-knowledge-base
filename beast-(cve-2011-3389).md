# Description

TLS 1.0 and earlier versions of the protocol have a serious flaw related to the way the Initialization Vector (IV) is handled.

A successful attacker can predict the IV and retrieve small fragments of data, such as HTTP session cookies, and authentication credentials, by guessing the input (cleartext) and analyzing the output (encrypted data) one byte at a time. For this, the attacker needs to listen to the HTTPS traffic between the victim and the server, while performing several requests to the server (around 128 requests per byte).

# Generic How-to fix

BEAST is a client-side vulnerability. Since the vulnerability became public, most major browsers addressed the problem by using a technique called 1/n-1 split.

However, it can also be mitigated server-side, by only supporting protocols TLS 1.1 and later.
