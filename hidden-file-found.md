We found a file in your application with potentially sensitive content. If attackers find it, they can use it to exploit or facilitate the exploitation of your application.

## How to fix

{% tabs hidden-file-found %}

If you donâ€™t need this file to run your application, remove it from the server. If you need it, move it to somewhere not accessible to users or set proper access permissions.
