*Probely Vulnerability Editor* is an open-source tool that allows you to preview the result of your changes before committing to the community repository.
You can edit already existant vulnerabilities, either by adding solutions in missing technologies or to *fix* any incoherent information on our data.

Your contribution is important to us. ü§ù

# How to edit a vulnerability
Each vulnerability is contained in a single file (```.md``` or ```.markdown``` extension). 

All the vulnerabity files must be kept in the ```_vulnerabilities``` folder.
When you feel like everything is done, submit your ```.md``` or ```.markdown``` file to our repository so we can review it and merge it ASAP.
